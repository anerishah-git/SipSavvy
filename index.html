                      <p> Despite being a beverage, soda can actually contribute to dehydration. The caffeine and sugar content in some sodas can have diuretic effects, increasing urine production and potentially leading to fluid loss. </p>

                      <p> Soda consumption has been linked to an increased risk of various chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and certain types of cancer. The high sugar content and empty calories in soda can contribute to these health conditions over time.</p>
