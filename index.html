                <summary>It is Dehydrating You</summary>
                <p> Despite being a beverage, soda can actually contribute to dehydration. The caffeine and sugar content in some sodas can have diuretic effects, increasing urine production and potentially leading to fluid loss. </p>

                <p> Soda consumption has been linked to an increased risk of various chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and certain types of cancer. The high sugar content and empty calories in soda can contribute to these health conditions over time.</p>

                  <p>Soda is high in added sugars and calories, which can contribute to weight gain and obesity. Regular consumption of sugary beverages can lead to an increased calorie intake without providing significant nutritional value. </p>
